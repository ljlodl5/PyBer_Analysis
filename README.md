# PyBer_Analysis
Rideshare Analysis and Visualization Techniques with Matplotlib

## **Overview of Pyber analysis**

Utilizing two sample rideshare datasets; 1) city data 2) ride data, the goal of this assignment is to present ridershare patterns across city types in order for Pyber to evaluate how to maximize profitability across rural, suburban and urban cities. 
The dataframe enclosed will provide a snapshot of Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver each city type incurs in order glean the rideshare supply and demand behaviors between January through early May 2019. 
Subsequently, the line graph of Weekly Total Fares by City Type displays profitability across city types but begs the question on how high the bar can be raised for Pyber based on trends from January to April 2019.   

## **Results**

### **RideShare Impacts: Multiple Data Indicators Across City Type** 
Enclosed is a summary dataframe comparing five indicators of ridershare experience between rural, suburban and urban cities between January and April 2019. The following results exist: 

#### ![Key Indicators](https://github.com/ljlodl5/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/THS%20pre%20NaN.png)

* **Rural**
The total supply (fares, rides and drivers) are the lowest of the three city types while the demand currently yields the highest average rate per fare and average rate per driver.
On the surface this is the expectation of low driver availability and the price users are willing to pay to utilize Pyber services. Presumably rural users are going further to their destination and willing to pay for the convenience, albeit much less frequently than the suburban and urban population.
* **Urban**
The total supply (fares, rides and drivers) are the highest of the three city types while the demand currently yields the lowest average rate per fare and average rate per driver.
Generally living without personal transportation, urban populations are in high-demand for public and private transportation to get to seemingly shorter destinations than suburban and rural populations. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver are smaller in part because demand and supply is high and distances shorter.    
* **Suburban**
Striking a balance in supply and demand, the total supply (fares, rides and drivers) remains in the middle for suburban clients. In addition, demand currently yields between rural and urban average rate per fare and average rate per driver.
Suburban clients have access to personal vehicles and thus have choices on whether the cost (more reasonable that rural rides) is worth the benefit of leaving personal vehicles at home. 
In the following line graph the suburban client appears to have trend differences based on the time of year, those trends need to be evaluated to determine how to maximize profit.   

### **RideShare Impacts: Total Weekly Fare per City Type between January-April 2019 ** 

Similar to the data provided above, the weekly total fare per city type represents the highest fares in urban population while rural populations remain consistently the lowest.

## **Summary**

### Based on the results between rural, suburban and urban ridershare experience, the following recommendations should be considered to address disparities:
* **Evaluating Supply**
Urban communities will always have hot demand for public and private transportation. The decision to use rideshare services is a matter of price and convenience among other available transportation types. 
In evaluating the line graph there seems to be a little more volatility in weekly total fares for urban users. Focus should be to examine what is causing dramatic dips with the goal to maintain consistently higher weekly fares.    
  
* **Understanding the Customer** 
Total rideshare usage in rural and suburban markets are less than urban markets, in part due to accessbility to transportation. Understanding why the customer is using Pyber in these markets can place appropriate focus on advertising services. 
For example, suburban users have an uptick in usability in warmer spring months. What is the draw to using rideshare and how can Pyber tap into the market to drive the demand for services all year? Can this same uptick, drive rural communities as well?
While the drop in rural cities during farming season may be as expected, there may be consumer opportunities to drive year-long demand with prices and services that are attractive to rural communities.   
 
* **Forecasting Events/Forecasting Optimal Price Points** 
Profits will be best served if the price point is effectively monitored based on demand and supply. In order to do this, Pyber needs a handle on how to forecast demand for drivers in order monitor proper supply and achieve advantageous price points. 
Pyber should consider looking at weeks with high returns across city types in order to replicate positive earnings and apply them to year-round successes in all city types. 
Another benefit would be to expand the datasets to see a larger window (ex. annual or multi-year view) in order to forecast demand/supply and take advantage of future opportunities.
